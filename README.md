# Warps plugin for Spigot

A simple, lightweight, fully-customizable, warps plugin for your Spigot server.

This plugin was originally developed for a project of mine called SFP (Simple Faction Project).
But since I abandoned the project, I decided to [publish the plugin for free on Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/warps-lightweight-easy-to-setup-customizable-1-13.65926/).
